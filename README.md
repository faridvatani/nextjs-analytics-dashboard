# Next.js Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

![Next.js Real-Time Analytics Dashboard](Screenshot.png)
A modern, real-time analytics dashboard built with Next.js, React, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Tailwind CSS.

This dashboard is designed to handle and visualize large amounts of analytical data in real time, using `server-sent events (SSE)` to continuously update the UI as new data arrives.

## ‚ú® Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (built on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/))
- **Backend:** [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Other:** TypeScript, Server-Sent Events (SSE), Docker

---

## üí° Features

- Real-time data streaming to the client via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Continuously seeded dummy data for live analytics simulation
- Fully customizable, accessible UI components using Shadcn UI
- Analytics-optimized data queries using advanced Prisma aggregations
- Modular schema design with support for analytical tables
- Tailwind CSS styling with easy customization
- Example models: sessions, page views, interactions

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- **Next.js custom server:** Enables long-lived SSE connections alongside standard request/response routes.
- **PostgreSQL database:** Stores analytical data; you manage it using Docker for local development.
- **Prisma:** Used as the ORM to define and query complex analytical data structures (e.g., grouping, aggregation).
- **Real-time seeding:** The server continuously inserts new dummy data into the database every few seconds to simulate live traffic.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faridvatani/nextjs-analytics-dashboard.git
cd nextjs-analytics-dashboard
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database connection details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example connection string for local Docker Postgres:

```ini
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start PostgreSQL with Docker

```bash
docker run --name postgres_container \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb \
  -d \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres
```

To start the container again later:

```bash
docker start postgres_container
```

To stop it:

```bash
docker stop postgres_container
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Set up the database schema

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
# or
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Seed dummy data (optional)

When you start the custom server, it will automatically start generating dummy data every few seconds to simulate active sessions and interactions.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Start the application

In one terminal, start the Next.js frontend:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

In another terminal, start the backend server:

```bash
pnpm dev:server
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Access the dashboard

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
You should see the dashboard automatically update with new data every few seconds ‚Äî no page refresh needed.

## üí¨ Additional Notes

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** This approach is simpler than websockets for one-way real-time updates (from server to client) and fits analytics dashboards very well.

- **PostgreSQL (OLAP):** Although typical OLAP workloads use specialized databases, this project demonstrates how you can still achieve analytical queries in PostgreSQL using aggregations and optimized queries via Prisma.

- **Prisma Models:** You can customize the models (Session, PageView, Interaction) to fit your own analytical needs. Check the prisma/schema.prisma file.

- **Component Library:** Uses Shadcn UI for fully customizable, accessible React components styled with Tailwind CSS.
